# Computer Systems Fundamentals
- Course Code: COMP1521
- Prerequisite: COMP1511
- Lecture: Andrew Taylor
- Contact Hour: 7 (2*2 hrs live session + 1 hr tutorial + 2 hrs lab)
- Language used: C, MIPS
- Assessment: Labs (15%) + Weekly tests (10%) + Assignment 1 (15%) Assignment 2 (15%) + Final (45%)
- Difficulty: 1.5/5 for the C and MIPS, 3/5 for file programming, 4/5 for the final
- Trimester when I did it: 20T2

This course introduced system level programming includes C and MIPS, which is an assembly language, as well as some basic knowledges of operating systems (hard to understand for students has few cs knowledge other than COMP1511). The assignments are simple (yet they becomes harder next term) but the last two questions in final is extremely hard. This is a gen ed but not I don't recommend students not doing cs or ee related degree to do this course.
