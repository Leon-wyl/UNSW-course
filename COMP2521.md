This course introduce some important data structures, such as Trees and Graphs, and some basic algorithms like binary search, sorting and hashing. The lecturer just read through the slides with strong accent. The topic is quite interesting but the assessment isn't. The labs require so much reading but just a few lines (some of them are quite hard). The quizzes and assignment is hard as well, especially for the last part of Assignment 2. I would recommend do JAS's 2521 for much easier assessments and clearer, understandable lectures (All people I know got 95+ in JAS's class). Unfortunately, JAS won't teach this course in 2021.
