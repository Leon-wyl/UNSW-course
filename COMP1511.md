This course is a fundamental course for any degrees related to computer science. Marc Chee, one of the most reputable lecturer, led students to learn how to programming in C from the most simplest 'Hello World' to data structures like queue and stack, with his memes. This course covers a lot of contents but not in detail, so the workload is not heavy. This course is gen ed and student not doing cs degrees can choose COMP1911 which has fewer contents than COMP1511 lighter workload.
